## Creator's Notes
This was a front end team project involvng the use of 2 APIs - one to track the global position of the ISS and Google Maps to provide nearby dining joints to eat at. The Station waits for no one and moves quickly.

My role in this group project was to help with CSS styling and write a function that would accept the long/lat of the ISS and provide that information to Google Maps

## The Goal

- a fully functional web app that makes use of 2 APIs

## APIs

-   Google maps
-   ISS coordinates

## What is dining with ISS all about?

-   Dining with ISS searches the nearest restaurant to the current location of the ISS.

 ## Challenges and Solutions
  - working with a team for the first time on a project - use of github and pull coordinations were tough, but overall we learned how to be in sync with push and pull with a team using github.
